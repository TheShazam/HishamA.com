My Personal Portfolio Website.

For my 2019 Winter break, I decided to pick up a new skill and learn Web-Development. I created a fully-functional responsive website to showcase my skills as an aspiring Software Engineer. 
Here are some features I worked with,

- Built a detailed contact info page showing my experiences.
- Built a functional category center to display projects I am working on/have worked on.
- Utilized Formspree as a general layout for my contact form.
- Implemented Google Map API to show a general mapping of where I am located.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages with Google Domains.
- Coded using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript libaries.
